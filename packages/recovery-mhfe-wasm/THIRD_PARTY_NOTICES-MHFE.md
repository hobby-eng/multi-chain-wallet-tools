# Third-party notices

The `mhfe` command-line tool and browser package include the following third-party material that
is not a Rust crate, each under its own licence. The Rust crates compiled into them, with the
licence each is used under and its text, are in
[`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md), which `scripts/third-party-licenses.py`
generates from `Cargo.lock` and which ships with every release.

## Argon2 reference implementation

- Source: https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2, commit
  `f57e61e19229e23c4445b85494dbf7c07de721cb`, vendored unchanged in `vendor/phc-winner-argon2/`.
- Copyright 2015 Daniel Dinu, Dmitry Khovratovich, Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Samuel Neves.
- Offered under CC0 1.0 or the Apache License 2.0, at the user's option. MHFE uses it under the
  **Apache License 2.0**. The licence text is in `vendor/phc-winner-argon2/LICENSE` and ships with
  every release. No file has been changed; any future change would be recorded as a separate patch
  file next to `vendor/phc-winner-argon2.md`.

## EFF large wordlist

- Source: https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt, included unchanged in
  `vendor/eff-large-wordlist/` and used by `mhfe password`.
- "EFF large wordlist" by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (Joseph Bonneau), licensed under the
  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0):

## Emscripten runtime (browser package)

- The browser package's `argon2-mt.js` and `argon2-st.js` are the Argon2 reference code compiled
  by Emscripten 6.0.10 (`scripts/build-argon2-wasm.sh`). Each holds Emscripten's JavaScript
  runtime and, inside its embedded WebAssembly, parts of Emscripten's system libraries: the musl C
  library, Emscripten's thread support, `dlmalloc` and `compiler-rt` builtins.
- Emscripten is offered under the MIT licence or the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source
  Licence. Its `LICENSE`, from the Emscripten 6.0.10 installation the build uses, unchanged except
  for one trailing space that Markdown formatting removes:

```text
Emscripten is available under 2 licenses, the MIT license and the
University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.

Both are permissive open source licenses, with little if any
practical difference between them.

The reason for offering both is that (1) the MIT license is
well-known, while (2) the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source
License allows Emscripten's code to be integrated upstream into
LLVM, which uses that license, should the opportunity arise.

The full text of both licenses follows.

The musl libc project is bundled in this repo, and it has the MIT license, see
system/lib/libc/musl/COPYRIGHT

The third_party/ subdirectory contains code with other licenses. None of it is
used by default, but certain options use it (e.g., the optional closure compiler
flag will run closure compiler from third_party/).
```

- musl is under the MIT licence. Its `COPYRIGHT` file, unchanged from
  `system/lib/libc/musl/COPYRIGHT` of the same installation:

```text
musl as a whole is licensed under the following standard MIT license:

Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
under terms compatible with the above MIT license:

The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or
Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited
and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.

The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
Lynn Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
the standard MIT terms.

The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
interest of source tree size.

In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
license, and to use these files without any requirement of
attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

Bobby Bingham
John Spencer
Nicholas J. Kain
Rich Felker
Richard Pennington
Stefan Kristiansson
Szabolcs Nagy

all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.

This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.
```

- `dlmalloc` was released to the public domain by Doug Lea (CC0 1.0), and `compiler-rt` is under
  the Apache License 2.0 with the LLVM exception, which lets compiled code embedded in a program
  be distributed without its notice. Neither needs a notice here.

## wasm-bindgen JavaScript glue (browser package)

- The first part of the browser package's `mhfe-worker.js` is the JavaScript glue that the
  wasm-bindgen command-line tool 0.2.129 writes for the WebAssembly core (`scripts/build-wasm.sh`).
  The `wasm-bindgen` crate itself is listed in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
- wasm-bindgen is offered under the MIT licence or the Apache License 2.0; MHFE uses it under the
  MIT licence. The notice, unchanged from the `LICENSE-MIT` file of the published
  `wasm-bindgen-cli-support` 0.2.129 crate, which generates the glue:
